# Tutu - Self balancing toy
Two actuators on either side controlling the wheels, powered by li-ion cells boosted to 5v, controlled by ESP32 S3, based on the data from IMU filtered by Kalman filter with PID controller. 
Currently balancing part is working, need to add wireless navigation through WIFI and camera feed and in the future SLAM and other AI features.
